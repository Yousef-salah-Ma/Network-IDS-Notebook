# Network Traffic Analysis & Attack Detection

## Description
This Jupyter Notebook is designed for analyzing network traffic and detecting cyber attacks such as DoS, DDoS, and Hulk attacks. It includes feature exploration, flow statistics, and visualization to aid in intrusion detection research.

## Features
- Analyze network flow data
- Explore packet-level statistics
- Visualize flow duration, packet size, and rates
- Detect anomalies and attack patterns

## Dataset
The notebook uses a network traffic dataset with features such as:
- Flow duration
- Forward/backward packet counts
- Packet lengths
- Flow bytes per second
- Packet inter-arrival times
- Attack labels (DoS, DDoS, Hulk, BENIGN)

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
Open the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook NetworkTrafficAnalysis.ipynb
Run the cells step by step to analyze the dataset and visualize results.
